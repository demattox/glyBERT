# glyBERT

Implementing BERT for glycan (glyBERT) to model glycan strucutres with appropriate "attention" paid to local and global structural context, demonstrating improved predictive performance compared to current state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.

---

We also demonstrate a proof of principle example of the first deep generative method to create novel glycans and optimize them for desired properties. Our generative process is limited but the framework could easily be extended to more productive and ambitious generative approaches.
